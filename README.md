# Binary-and-XML-Serialization
BInary and XML serialization written by C++
* This project is my OOP course homework.
* tinyxml2.cpp and tinyxml2.h are downloaded online to complete the xml serialization easier, so they are not my code.
* BinarySerialize.hpp includes the binary serialization functions of most C++ data type like string and map and some user-defined structure. 
* XMLserialize.h includes the xml serialization functions the same as BinarySerialize, and it will store the data as xml file.
